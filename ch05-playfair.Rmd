# The Big Bang: William Playfair, the Father of Modern Graphics {#ch05-playfair}

```{block, type="chapterprelude"}
#### Synopsis {-}

At the beginning of the 19th Century, nearly all of the modern forms of data graphics--- the pie chart, the line graph of a time series, and the bar chart--- were invented. These key developments were all due to a wily Scot named William Playfair. He can rightly be called the father of modern graphical methods, and it is only a slight stretch to consider his contributions to be the Big Bang of data graphics.
