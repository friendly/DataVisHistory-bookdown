# The Golden Age of Statistical Graphics {#ch07-golden}


```{block, type="chapterprelude"}
#### Synopsis {-}
In the latter half of the 19th Century, enthusiasm for graphical methods matured, and a variety of developments in statistics, data collection and technology combined to produce a "perfect storm" for data graphics. The result was a qualitatively distinct period that produced works of unparalleled beauty and scope, the likes of which would be hard to duplicate today. We argue that this period deserves to be recognized as the "Golden Age of Statistical Graphics."
