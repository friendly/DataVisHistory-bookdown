# The Birth of Data {#ch03-data}

```{block, type="chapterprelude"}
#### Synopsis {-}
This chapter traces the role of data in the initial rise of graphical methods around the early 1800s.
We start with the very idea of numbers used for some wider purpose, and considered what what we now
call "data".
We focus attention on one important participant in this story: Andr\'e-Michel Guerry [1802--1866], who used an "avalanche of data" and graphical methods to help invent modern social science.
